Design source files from v0.dev for AI-assisted UI adaptation.

## Workflow

### Automatic (recommended)

1. Set `V0_API_KEY` in your environment (get one at v0.dev/chat/settings/keys)
2. Run `/adapt-v0 <v0-url>` in Claude Code
3. The command pulls source files via the v0 API and adapts them to project conventions

### Manual

1. Export code from v0 (Download ZIP or copy from the editor)
2. Create a folder here named after the feature (kebab-case)
3. Drop in the `.tsx` files + optional `notes.md`
4. Run `/adapt-v0 <folder-name>` in Claude Code

## Folder Structure

    designs/
      _template-notes.md        ← Copy to notes.md in any feature folder
      AGENTS.md                 ← Context for AI tools
      vacation-rental-website/
        manifest.json            ← Auto-generated by fetch script
        app/page.tsx             ← v0 source files (preserving v0's paths)
        components/...
        notes.md                 ← Optional adaptation instructions

## Tips

- Use the API path when possible — preserves v0's complete file structure.
- Name your v0 chats well — the chat title becomes the folder name.
- One v0 chat per folder — multi-page projects stay in a single folder.
- Don't delete after adaptation — these serve as design history.
